potentially affected by \n\ntropospheric delay, \n\nsolid earth tides (SET) and \n\nionospheric delay \n\nYunjun et al., 2022.\n\nIonospheric delay\n\nAt altitudes above ∼50 km, radiation (mainly from the Sun) ionizes atmospheric atoms and molecules forming the ionosphere. Its refractivity is mainly controlled by the \n\ntotal electron content. The propagation of the microwave signal traveling through the ionosphere results in a group delay and a phase advance.\n\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI)\n\nThe undesired signal in the form of wideband or narrowband interference that overlaps with the in-band frequency spectrum of NISAR. The main sources of high-power RFI are electromagnetic signals from civilian and military ground-based communication or radar platforms. RFI detection is performed on L0B raw data before focusing.\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction (RTC)\n\nThe NISAR geocoded covariance (GCOV) product is radiometrically terrain\ncorrected to normalize the SAR backscatter to gamma-naught \\gamma^0. The GCOV algorithm is using an area-projection algorithm \n\nShiroma et al., 2022 to compute RTC correction factor and to geocode the data.\n\nSolid Earth Tides (SET)\n\nThe motion of the Earth’s surface is driven by the gravitational pull from the Sun and the Moon (solid Earth tides), the change of the rotational axis (pole tides), the loading\neffects from the ocean tides (OTL), the atmospheric and hydrological loading as well as the surface deformation. Displacements from tidal and loading effects are periodic with different time scales and amplitudes \n\nYunjun et al., 2022. SET often reaches 40 and 10 cm in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively \n\nPetit & Luzum, 2010.\n\nTotal Electron Content\n\nTwo components of the Total Electron Content (TEC) data from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are sampled every 10 seconds along the NISAR orbit: the integrated TEC from surface to the GNSS orbit and the top-side TEC. The difference of the two results in sub-orbital TEC is used to estimate range delay and the azimuth shifts.\n\nTropospheric delay\n\nAt altitudes up to ~ 30 km, which forms the troposphere, refractivity is mainly controlled by temperature, water vapor, and dry air partial pressure \n\nBerrada Baby et al., 1988. The zenith hydrostatic delay is ~2.3 m at sea level at typical meteorological conditions, while the zenith wet delay varies from a few mm at the polar region to ∼40 cm at the equatorial region \n\nBöhm & Schuh, 2013. The tropospheric delay is corrected using a static tropospherical model (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) during focusing the raw data.","type":"content","url":"/glossary#general","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"Radar grid (metadata cube)"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/glossary#radar-grid-metadata-cube","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"Radar grid (metadata cube)"},"content":"referenceSlantRange / secondarySlantRange\n\nThe range position of the zero-Doppler grid in maters for each point of the geographical grid of the reference/secondary RSLS.\n\nreferenceZeroDopplerAzimuthTime / secondaryZeroDopplerAzimuthTime\n\nThe zero-Dopple azimuth time of the zero-Doppler grid in seconds for each point of the geographical grid of the reference/secondary RSLC.\n\ncoordinateX\n\nThe mapping of the zero-Doppler grid to the geographic grid (x component) in the units of the projection.\n\ncoordinateY\n\nThe mapping of the zero-Doppler grid to the geographic grid (y component) in the units of the projection.\n\nlosUnitVectorX\n\nThe East component of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) unit vector from the target to the sensor in the East-North-Up coordinate system for each point of the geographic grid.\n\nlosUnitVectorY\n\nThe North component of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) unit vector from the target to the sensor in the East-North-Up coordinate system for each point of the geographic grid.\n\nlosUnitVectorZ\n\nThe Up component of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) unit vector from the target to the sensor in the East-North-Up coordinate system for each point of the geographic grid.

This part of the NISAR data is best represented in the GCOV products. The individual covariance layers in the GCOV product can be used like Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products. The pixel values represent the intensity of radar backscatter, with a different layer for each polarization.\n\nThe values in the GCOV covariance layers represent the conditions of the scatterers on the earth’s surface in that area, and can indicate the degree of surface roughness, structural complexity, and relative moisture content. These values are impacted by changes to the physical structure of the earth’s surface, including processes that alter vegetation or built structures.\n\nBecause of NISAR’s regular acquisition schedule and insensitivity to cloud cover, data is available at regular intervals all over the world. This makes it very valuable for time-series analysis, which can be used to track short- or long-term changes to natural and anthropogenic features.\n\nThe L-band sensor can penetrate through moderately complex vegetation and more deeply into the soil than C-band SAR sensors such as Sentinel-1. This provides insight into the conditions under the canopy, and at deeper levels in the soil column, and having observations using both wavelengths (and, in some areas, S-band data in addition) increases the ability to understand processes driving change on the landscape.","type":"content","url":"/amplitude","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Applications Overview"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/applications-overview","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Applications Overview"},"content":"NISAR data can be used for a broad range of applications, as indicated by the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:NISAR applications overview\n\nMore information related to applications can be found in the \n\nNASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Mission Science Users’ Handbook \n\nNISAR, 2025, \n\napplications white papers and the \n\nAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs).\n\nRefer also to the interactive \n\nNISAR StoryMap Tutorials illustrating how NISAR data can be used for a range of applications.","type":"content","url":"/applications-overview","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/phase","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase"},"content":"The phase measures the location of the SAR signal along its wave cycle when it returns to the sensor. This can be used as a proxy for distance, and is the basis of SAR Interferometry (InSAR). By differencing the phase values from one acquisition to another with the same footprint, InSAR allows users to identify and quantify surface deformation that occurred in the time between acquisitions.\n\nInSAR analysis can quantify differences in the line-of-sight of the sensor to the centimeter scale, making it a powerful tool for monitoring deformation over large areas. It can be used in conjunction with GNSS measurements, surveys, and LiDAR measurements to expand these high-accuracy measurements to a much broader scale.\n\nPhase measurements, especially at L-band wavelengths, are sensitive to atmospheric changes from one acquisition to the next, so it is vital to consider how these changes can impact your interpretation of InSAR measurements. NISAR provides a number of resources packaged in with products such as the GUNWs that can be used for atmospheric corrections, and there are also time-series approaches that can help mitigate the impact of atmospheric conditions.\n\nInSAR analysis can be used to detect and quantify surface movements or changes caused by geophysical processes or human activities that result in the signal having to travel a different distance to interact with the scattering surface. This can be due to volcanic or tectonic activity, earth-moving for construction or extraction purposes, and subsidence or uplift due to changes in groundwater or underground reservoirs.\n\nInSAR also generates a coherence measurement, which may be useful for indicating change. If the phase spectra from one acquisition to another differ so much that they can’t be compared, that can indicate an area that has undergone such drastic change that it can’t be resolved. This indicates the quality of the phase difference calculation, but can also serve as an indicator of change.","type":"content","url":"/phase","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Available NISAR Data"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/availability-overview","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Available NISAR Data"},"content":"NISAR launched July 30, 2025, and has been successfully collecting data through its Commissioning phase and into the Science phase.

These phase corrections, when available, are not removed from the interferometric data.","type":"content","url":"/gunw#gunw-product-overview","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Soil Moisture (SME2)"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/sme2","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Soil Moisture (SME2)"},"content":"Product Specification\n\n\nFind Data","type":"content","url":"/sme2","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Soil Moisture (SME2)","lvl2":"Product Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sme2#sme2-product-overview","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Soil Moisture (SME2)","lvl2":"Product Overview"},"content":"NISAR backscatter observations will estimate a global high-resolution soil moisture product at a pixel spacing of 200 m.

No soil moisture retrievals will be provided for areas with urban build-up, permanent snow and ice cover, or permanent inland waterbodies, and these pixels will be flagged appropriately.

These grids are defined for all NISAR level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2) products. Users are advised to use three-dimensional interpolation routines (for Python, use the RegularGridInterpolator function of the open-source software scipy) to calculate values for several parameters for useful initial data analysis within a GIS environment. The geolocation error using the grids is estimated to be 1.5 cm. Further analysis is expected to lead to a more robust error estimate.\n\nThe example below shows the geolocation grid defined for an L1 RIFG product.
